# Itinerary by clicktravel.com

Your clicktravel bookings are always at hand, even when you don't have Internet access.

# Setup
Run `npm i` to install project dependencies.
# Development
Run `npm start` to start the development environment on `localhost:3000`. In order to develop locally, you will need a client ID. Currently, client ID's are issued on request by contacting engineering@clicktravel.com.
# Deployment
Run `npm run build` to run a full build of the application. The contents of `/public` are to be served as a static site.

If you have not applied for a client ID, you can still raise issues and submit improvements. We are open to any feedback and suggestions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
